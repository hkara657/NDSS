The existing implementation of AES is used from openssl crypto library - EVP Symmetric Encryption and Decryption

Reference - https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/EVP_Symmetric_Encryption_and_Decryption


We conduct 4 different types of tests - 

1. Known Answer Test (KAT)       - Tests the correctness of AES implementation using single block messages (128 bit messages).

2. Multiblock Message Test (MMT) - Tests the correctness of OFB mode of AES using multi block messages (128, 256, 384 and 512 bit messages).

3. Monte-Carlo Tests (MCT)       - Tests the pseudorandomness of OFB mode by generating 100 pseudo-random tests.

4. Statistical Tests             - These tests include the Frequency Test, Serial Test and Poker Test. All of them test the randomness of the ciphertext output by AES OFB mode. 
					Frequency Test checks for roughly equal number of 0's and 1's in the ciphertext.
					Serial Test checks for roughly equal number of 00's, 01's, 10's and 11's in the ciphertext.
					Poker Test checks for roughly equal number of non-overlapping 000's, 001's, 010's, 011's, 100's, 101's, 110's and 111's in the ciphertext.
				All of them output a statistic value that should obey a particular chi-square distribution.


KAT, MMT and MCT tests are taken from the Advanced Encryption Standard Algorithm Validation System(AESAVS)

Statistical Test are taken from Handbook of Cryptography chapter 5 (section 5.4.4)


For each test, we take the appropriate input from the Test vectors and match it with the corresponding output from the Test vector response files.

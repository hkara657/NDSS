We can conclude the following - 

1. From the statistical tests, we can infer that AES with 256 bit key is more cryptographically secure than AES with 192 bit key which in turn is more secure than AES with 128 bit key.

2. AES in OFB mode is a good source of pseudorandom bits. This can be inferred from the Monte-Carlo Tests and Statistical Tests.
